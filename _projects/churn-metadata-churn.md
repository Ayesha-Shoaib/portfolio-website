title: "Why Subscription Metadata Fails to Predict Churn"
permalink: /projects/churn-metadata-churn/
---

## Overview

This project investigates whether subscription-level commercial metadata can predict SaaS churn.

Using lifecycle segmentation, churn timing analysis, and a logistic regression baseline model, I tested whether plan configuration and revenue attributes meaningfully differentiate churn risk.

---

## Key Result

**ROC-AUC ≈ 0.51**

Commercial subscription metadata alone performs near random.

---

## Strategic Insight

Churn is likely driven by activation and behavioral engagement dynamics rather than pricing configuration.

## Interactive Dashboard

An executive-facing dashboard was built in Count to communicate findings clearly.
