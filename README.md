# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. This repository contains my projects in causal inference and predictive modeling.

## Featured Project: Olist Subscription Uplift Engine
[Live Interactive Dashboard](https://olist-uplift-engine.streamlit.app/)

### Project Overview
I built a causal machine learning solution for Olist to improve voucher distribution. This engine identifies persuadable users. These are customers who only buy if they receive an incentive.

* **Models Used:** S Learner, T Learner, and X Learner.
* **Key Tech:** Python, XGBoost, Streamlit, Plotly.
* **Business Impact:** I found an optimal targeting threshold of 69 percent. This reduces marketing waste while keeping incremental revenue.

## Future Projects
* **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction:** Predicting long term value with probabilistic models.
* **Inventory Optimization:** A time series tool for stock management.
