## 📈 Olist Subscription Uplift Engine  
[Live Interactive Dashboard](https://olist-uplift-engine.streamlit.app/)  
[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayesha-Shoaib/olist-uplift-engine)

### Project Overview
I built a causal machine learning solution for Olist to optimize voucher distribution.  
The engine identifies persuadable users — customers who purchase only when incentivized.

**Models Used:**  
- S-Learner  
- T-Learner  
- X-Learner  

**Tech Stack:** Python, XGBoost, CausalML, Streamlit, Plotly  

**Business Impact:**  
Identified an optimal targeting threshold of 69 percent, reducing marketing waste while preserving incremental revenue.

## 📊 Why Subscription Metadata Fails to Predict Churn  
[Interactive Count Dashboard](https://app.count.co/canvas/ETYO0D78PhN))  
[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayesha-Shoaib/saas-churn-analysis)

### Project Overview
This project investigates whether subscription-level commercial metadata (MRR, plan tier, seats, billing frequency, renewals) can effectively predict SaaS churn.

Using lifecycle segmentation, churn timing analysis, and a baseline logistic regression model, I tested whether pricing configuration meaningfully differentiates churn risk.

**Model Performance:**  
ROC-AUC ≈ 0.51 (near random)

### Key Insight
Commercial subscription metadata alone does not meaningfully predict churn.  
Predictive signal likely resides in activation milestones and behavioral engagement metrics rather than pricing configuration.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Count BI
